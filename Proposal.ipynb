    "Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "A 2022 study conducted by John Dunham and Associates found that the wine industry accounts for $276.07 billion economic output in America. While wine is a cornerstone of the US economy, few individuals are actually experts in the subject, with only 269 Master Sommeliers in the world. There is a clear disconnect between the economic impact of wine, and the number of individuals trained to assess a wine's quality, leaving room for restaraunts, liquor stores, and wineries to over (or under) price wines for consumers. During our project, we will be using data that can be easily found on wine labels to see if we can predict the quality [0-10] of a red wine using regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset chosen was collected by Cortez et al.(2009) for their paper, \"Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties\", in which they modelled wine preference on a scale of 0 [bad] to 10 [excellent].\n",

    "Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, alcohol will be used, as ethanol as a compound is known to impact individuals perception of wine flavor, thus influencing percieved quality (Caballero & Segura, 2017). Secondly, total sulfur dioxide will be used, total sulfure dioxide acts as an antioxidant and is necessary in winemaking, however there are legal limits to sulfur dioxide concentration (Araptisas et al.,  2018). \n",
