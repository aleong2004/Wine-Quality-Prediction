    "A 2022 study conducted by John Dunham and Associates found that the wine industry accounts for $276.07 billion economic output in America. While wine is a cornerstone of the US economy, few individuals are actually experts in the subject, with only 269 Master Sommeliers in the world. There is a clear disconnect between the economic impact of wine, and the number of individuals trained to assess a wine's quality, leaving room for restaraunts, liquor stores, and wineries to over (or under) price wines for consumers. During our project, we will be using predictors that could be found by contacting wine producers to see if we can predict the quality [0-10] of a red wine using regression.\n",

Secondly, total sulfur dioxide will be used, total sulfure dioxide acts as an antioxidant and is necessary in winemaking with probable impacts on quality (Araptisas et al.,  2018).\n",

Rounding our pridicted number to the nearest integer will gives a quality score that could be easily checked by the confusion matrix. We will its the outputs to calculate the accuracy score. \n",

    "High quality wines have intense flavours that last a long time, even after swallowing the wine. This analysis would be helpful to both the consumers and buisnesses like restaurants and hotels. If we find our model has a suitable level of accuracy, consumers could use our model to understand whether they believe they are paying a suitable price for the percieved wine quality, using factors from a wine's ingredients list. This would help consumers single out good quality wine without spending their hard earned money.\n",

    "\n",
    "Future questions: \n",
    "If our data analysis is successful, we can look into other factors that determine the quality of a particular wine like its oriign, growing practices(grapes), winemaking practices, temperature at which it's fermented, age, etc. We can also conduct a data analysis linking price to the quality of wine. \n"
